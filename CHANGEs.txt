CHANGES  for lineno.sty v4.41  2005/11/02:

1. Loadable after amsmath.

2. Removed some nonsense from documentation.


CHANGES  for lineno.sty v4.4   2005/10/27:
[failed to be uploaded to CTAN, but distributed by mail]:

1. Proper effective line depth at end of paragraphs.
   The spacing bug was quite obvious in two-column mode
   when a paragraph end was at a column bottom.

2. Another bug concerning two-column mode that had been
   introduced in v4.22 has been removed again.

3. Support for \addvspace introduced more and more bugs
   in versions of v4.32 and v4.33. The reasons seem to
   be clear now, and v4.4 should be stable.


CHANGES  for lineno.sty v4.32  2005/10/17:

1. Support for \addvspace
   (a math display or a list meets a heading -- or a sub-heading
   follows a heading -- or the like)

2. Clearly explained former option `displaymath' and its change
   to a default.


CHANGES  for lineno.sty v4.31  2005/10/01:

1. \modulolinenumbers* and a package option `modulo*' for
   printing first line number after interrupting editor's
   text, regardless of the modulo.

2. Improved explanation of \firstlinenumber and package
   options.


CHANGES  for lineno.sty v4.3   2005/05/16:

1. Option `displaymath' (proper numbering at paragraphs
   containing math displays) becomes default.

2. Compatibility with hyperref now indeed (at least much more).

3. Tidied up documentation: terrible confusion of \newcounter
   vs. \stepcounter; sections on the same matter written at
   different times; ...

4. Additional internal improvements that perhaps hardly are
   observable (no more spurious linenumbers in math displays
   from vertical mode; some compatibity with packages that use
   \holdinginserts; \linelabel in headings etc.).


CHANGES  for lineno.sty v4.22  2005/05/09:

1. Restored "global" version of numbering lines of a \parbox or
   minipage or ... (I had missed and disabled this in taking
   over lineno.sty), explained in documentation (lineno.pdf/dvi
   subsec. 7.2).

2. Enabled \flushbottom in two-column pagewise or switching
   mode.

3. Re-implemented modulo mode -- disabling certain users' tricks
   see lineno.pdf sec. 5.5, also for a still supported
   substituting trick.

4. Tidied up setting the next line number globally vs. locally
   (TeXbook p. 301).

5. Tidied up discussions (in documentation) of possible changes
   in implementation.


CHANGES  for lineno.sty v4.21  2005/04/28:

Removed serious flaws with math display, + something ...


CHANGES  for lineno.sty v4.2   2005/04/26:

1. Re-enabled package option `displaymath' (needed rearrangement
   after sec. 5).

2. New package option `addpageno' for adding page numbers to
   line number references -- see sec. 6.1 of lineno.pdf.

3. Improved support for \includeonly (and improved sec. 5.3,
   p. 27).

4. Improved compatibility with other packages that change \output
   (tameflts.sty, e.g., for saving footnotes against \marginpar
   and floats), added advice on this matter -- sec. 2.3,
   pp. 7, 14f.


CHANGES  for lineno.sty v4.11  2005/03/08:

1. The `edtable' option now supports math environments like
`array'. This requires updating edtable.sty to v1.3. (The claim
in previous versions of edtable on this support simply was
wrong, sorry.) For how to make use of this support, we urge you
to read the usage instructions in edtable.sty (v1.3). These have
been extended very much, structured more clearly, and supplied
with examples.

2. \linelabel now complains when appearing outside line
numbering mode. This counters Stephan Boettcher's original
intention, but I generalize from my own experience that it is
helpful to be told when you have forgotten to switch into line
numbering mode and (e.g.) wonder why all the line number
references are 1 ... ednotes.sty users profit as well (at least
I expect and hope that anybody profits, which, to be sure, does
not mean that I hope that anybody forgets to switch ...).

3. The subsection on `edtable' in lineno.sty/tex/pdf was not
quite correct or complete -- corrected, improved.

4. The final list of user commands in lineno.sty/tex/pdf has not
been complete. This has not changed, but it is briefly explained
what is missing and where it can be found.


CHANGE  2005/01/20:

We have devised macros for indexing with line numbers,
yet we don't take the time to release them officially.

CHANGES  for lineno.sty v4.1   2004/10/19:

Extension packages from the Ednotes bundle for enabling
\linelabel in math mode and tabular environments are now
handled through new package options `mathrefs', `edtable',
`longtable', and `nolongtablepatch'. Two of these extension
packages moved from the ednotes folder to the lineno folder.
lineno.tex/pdf has been updated accordingly.
(From README.txt -- KW) minor fixes (removed `supported/', e.g.);
bracketed text; lines with `(UL)'; redistribution with README only.

CHANGES  for lineno.sty v4.00  2004/09/03:

o incorporated earlier extension packages linenox0.sty,
  linenox1.sty, lnopatch.sty (which belonged to the
  Ednotes bundle before);

o adopted LaTeX Project Public License v1.3.
